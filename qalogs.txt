Q: how much quantity of water can average water bottle contain
A: Embedded water is water used to produce food and non-food products, this includes plastics.
In fact, plastic bottles take about three times as much water to produce than they can actually hold.
Topping up your reusable water bottle will reduce your water footprint by reducing your plastic consumption.

Q: what can you compute
A: - Calculating the percentage gain of an investment is quite easy.
Find out how to calculate net profit; Know how to review your sales; Work out how to .
AA: [u'\nVisualize what a percentage represents. A percentage is an expression of part of the whole. Nothing is represented by 0%, and the whole amount is 100%. Everything else is somewhere in between![1]\n\nFor example, say you have 10 apples. If you eat 2 apples, then you have eaten 2 out of the whole 10 apples (2 / 10 \xd7 100% = 20% eaten). If 10 apples is 100% and you ate 20%, then 100% - 20% = 80% of the apples remain.\nThe term "percent" in English comes from the Latin per centum, meaning \u201cthrough 100\u201d or \u201cfor 100\u201d.\nThe percentage symbol is merely a format. In statistics, percentages are often left in their base form of 0 - 1, where 1 represents the whole. We merely multiply a decimal by a factor of 100% to format the answer.\n\nWH.performance.mark(\'step1_rendered\');\n', u"\nDetermine the value of the whole. In some cases, you will be given the value for part of the whole and the whole. Other times, you might get two parts that make up the whole. It is important to distinguish what the percentage is \u201cof.\u201d For instance, let's say we have a jar containing 1199 red marbles and 485 blue marbles, making it 1684 marbles in total. In this case, 1684 makes up a whole jar of marbles, i.e. 100%.[2]\n", u"\nFind the value that you want to turn into a percentage. Let's say we want to find out the percentage of the jar that is taken up by the blue marbles. Then the percentage of the whole we are looking for is 485 (the number of blue marbles) of 1684 (the whole amount).[3]\n", u'\nPut the two values into a fraction. The part goes on top of the fraction (numerator), and the whole goes on the bottom (denominator). Therefore the fraction in this case is 485/1684 (part/whole).[4]\n', u'\nConvert the fraction into a decimal. Percentages are best calculated from the decimal form. To turn 485/1684 into a decimal, divide 485 by 1684 using a calculator or pencil and paper. This comes to 0.288.[5]\n', u'\nConvert the decimal into a percent. Multiply the result obtained in the step above by 100% (per 100 = per cent). For this example, 0.288 multiplied by 100% equals 28.8%.[6]\n\nA simple way to multiply a decimal by 100 is to move the decimal to the right two digits.\nThe percent symbol is then just tacked on at the end, like a unit of measurement would be.\n\n', u"\nIdentify the given numbers you're working with. Say you borrowed money from a friend who is going to charge you daily interest. The amount borrowed was initially $15 and the interest rate is 3% per day. These are the only two numbers you need for the calculation.[7]\n", u'\nConvert the percentage into a decimal. Working backward from before, divide the percentage by 100%, or you can multiply by 0.01 (they\u2019re the exact same). 3%/100% = 3/100 = 0.03. You can also simply move the decimal to the left two places.[8]\n', u'\nRe-word the problem with your new values. It helps to reword your problem with the new value(s) now in the form of \u201cX of Y is Z.\u201d X is the decimal form of your percent, \u201cof\u201d means to multiply, Y is the whole amount, and Z is the answer. So, 0.03 x $15 is $0.45.[9]\n\nIn this example, $0.45 is the amount of interest accrued each day that you do not pay your friend back.\nIf you need to further calculate the total due after 1 day, you would add the amount you borrowed to the amount of the interest times the number of days. So $15 + ($0.45 x 1 day) = $15.45.\n\n', u'\nWrite down the original price and the discount percentage. The original price is usually the big number that retailers will mark through or make especially large so you know how good of a \u201cdeal\u201d you\u2019re getting.[10]\n\nBe sure to also pay attention to whether the discounted percentage applies to a single item or the total.\nIf it is the total, you would add up all the original prices to get your whole amount to which you apply the percentage discount. Otherwise, you will only apply the discount to the single original price.\n\n', u'\nFind the opposite of the discount percentage. This trick lets you perform 1 calculation instead of 2! The opposite of a percent is 100% minus the percent you are working with, i.e. the amount of the item you are still paying for. If you want to buy a shirt that is 30% off, the opposite of this is 70%, meaning you would have to pay 70% of the original price.[11]\n', u'\nConvert the opposite percent into a decimal. To convert a percent into a decimal, divide by 100%, multiply times 0.01, or move the decimal two places to the left. In this example, 70%/100% = 70/100 = 7/10 = 0.7.[12]\n', u'\nMultiply the original price by the new decimal. If the shirt you want is $20, multiply $20 by 0.7. This comes to $14, meaning the shirt is now on sale for $14.[13]\n', u'\nCalculate your savings afterward to feel better. Once you get home, it can be a good idea to check your receipts, not only to make sure the discounts were applied correctly but to see how much you saved altogether. Here, you can simply subtract the sale price from the original price ($20 - $14 = $6 saved)!\n\n']

Then, fold down the top corners while leaving 1-2 in (2.5-5 cm) of space at the bottom. Grab the two top corners, and fold down so that they line up with the center crease.

Pick up the triangle, rotate it 45 degrees, then use your fingers to open up the bottom of the triangle. It should naturally start to pop into a square shape -- the bottom corners of the triangle should fold over each other and become the bottom corner of a diamond.
